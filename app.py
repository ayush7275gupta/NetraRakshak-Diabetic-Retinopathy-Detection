    "what is diabetic retinopathy": 
        "Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can affect people with diabetes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye). The condition can develop in anyone who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes.",
    
    "what causes diabetic retinopathy": 
        "Diabetic retinopathy is caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the blood vessels in the retina. Over time, these blood vessels may leak fluid or hemorrhage (bleed), distorting vision. In its advanced stages, the disease can cause new, abnormal blood vessels to grow on the surface of the retina, which can lead to serious vision problems and even blindness.",
    
    "what are the symptoms": 
        "Early diabetic retinopathy often has no symptoms. As the condition progresses, symptoms may include: floating spots in your vision, blurred vision, fluctuating vision, impaired color vision, dark areas in your vision, and vision loss. Many people with early diabetic retinopathy don't notice changes to their vision.",
    
    "what are the stages": 
        "Diabetic retinopathy has four main stages: 1) Mild nonproliferative retinopathy - small areas of balloon-like swelling in the retina's tiny blood vessels. 2) Moderate nonproliferative retinopathy - blockage of some retinal blood vessels. 3) Severe nonproliferative retinopathy - more blood vessels are blocked, depriving several areas of the retina of blood supply. 4) Proliferative retinopathy - the most advanced stage where new, abnormal blood vessels grow along the retina and into the vitreous gel.",
    
    "how is it diagnosed": 
        "Diabetic retinopathy is diagnosed through a comprehensive eye examination. This may include visual acuity testing, dilated eye exam, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescein angiography. Regular eye exams are crucial for early detection.",
    
    "how is it treated": 
        "Treatment depends on the stage of diabetic retinopathy and may include managing diabetes better (controlling blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol), laser treatment (photocoagulation), anti-VEGF drugs, vitrectomy surgery, or corticosteroids. Early treatment can slow or stop the progression of the disease.",
    
    "can it be prevented": 
        "While not all cases can be prevented, the risk can be significantly reduced by managing diabetes effectively, maintaining target blood sugar levels, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, not smoking, regular exercise, and having regular eye exams.",
    
    "what is no dr": 
        "No DR (No Diabetic Retinopathy) means that the eye examination shows no signs of diabetic retinopathy. This is the optimal condition for someone with diabetes, indicating their retina appears healthy without visible damage from diabetes.",
    
    "what is mild dr": 
        "Mild Diabetic Retinopathy is the earliest detectable stage of the condition. It's characterized by small areas of balloon-like swelling in the retina's tiny blood vessels, called microaneurysms. At this stage, most people don't experience vision changes.",
    
    "what is moderate dr": 
        "Moderate Diabetic Retinopathy occurs as the disease progresses and more blood vessels are affected. Blood vessels may swell and distort, losing their ability to transport blood. Both the blood vessel walls and the retina may show visible changes, and some patients may begin to notice vision problems.",
    
    "what is severe dr": 
        "Severe Diabetic Retinopathy is characterized by significant blockage of blood vessels supplying the retina, resulting in deprived areas of blood supply. The retina signals the body to grow new blood vessels (neovascularization is beginning). Vision may be noticeably affected at this stage.",
    
    "what is proliferative dr": 
        "Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) is the most advanced stage of the disease. The retina grows new, abnormal blood vessels (proliferation) which often bleed into the vitreous. These fragile vessels can form scar tissue that may cause the retina to detach. PDR can lead to serious vision loss or blindness and requires immediate medical attention.",

    This application combines:
    
    1. **Image Classification**: A deep learning model (ResNet152) trained on retinal images to classify different stages of diabetic retinopathy.
    
    2. **Intelligent Chatbot**: A hybrid system that uses both a specialized knowledge base about diabetic retinopathy and Microsoft's DialoGPT language model for natural conversation.
    
    The classification categories are:
    - **No DR**: No diabetic retinopathy detected
    - **Mild**: Mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy
    - **Moderate**: Moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy
    - **Severe**: Severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy
    - **Proliferative DR**: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy
    
    The chatbot can answer specific questions about diabetic retinopathy while also engaging in general conversation about eye health and related topics.
